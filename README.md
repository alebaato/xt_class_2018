## Lesson 1 - Git Hub + Project Setup
* Please create a Git Hub repository, with a SSH Key authentication and a README.md.
* Create HTML5 Skeleton page with an unstyled teaser element (image, headline, excerpt, link).
* Include a normalize or css reset, and give reasons why you used it in the README.
* Add as Collaborators to your GitHub repository:
  * [0m4r (Omar Adobati) · GitHub](https://github.com/0m4r)
  * [bwcgn (Bastian Winkler) · GitHub](https://github.com/bwcgn)


## Built With
* [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) <br/>
To achieve a more consistent rendering of elements across browsers we include normalize.css. Common bugs get corrected and usefull defaults are preserved.
